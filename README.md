#README

Names of all contributors to the project. We should be able to see their contributions in the "Contributors" graph and commit history.

A summary: a brief [2-10 sentences] summary of the project, on the level of a description in an app store (i.e., it should "sell" your app). Make sure to describe the problem that your project aims to solve.

Who are your users?

Describe your MVP. What features are essential for your MVP? Whatever you built should be fully functional, so make sure you get your MVP working before adding extra features and functionality.

Describe the functionality of your project to the potential users. This overview should convince the user that they want your product and to inform an already existing user of all features that you offer. This description can include pictures, diagrams, text, bullets, or whatever you think will best convey the functionality that you are offering. (Make sure to properly label and caption all your figures and tables.) Describe the installation steps of the project: assuming that someone has Rails and Github installed, what commands do they need to run to get the project working on their computer? Make sure to verify that your instructions work by cloning from Github and following the instructions to set up the project from scratch.

Discuss the key issues that arose in the development of you project and what you did to resolve them.

Discuss major issues still present (e.g., "Known bugs"): what the problem is, what options have been tried or considered, and how those options might fall short.

References. List all the resources that you used to create your project. Books, tutorials, templates, libraries, helpful StackOverflow pages -- if it was useful, include it, and make sure to reference it in the appropriate section of the README. (Choose whatever citation format you like (e.g., APA) and use it consistently.) If you installed any additional gems, list them here as well.
